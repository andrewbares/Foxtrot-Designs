	<h2>About Foxtrot Design</h2>
	<p>
		We had lots of fun designing this website. Even though we are a fictitious company, we have realized that
		having a website is very important for any business. If you own a business it's important to maintain an online
		presence, and having a website for that business is a crucial step forward in keeping your potential
		customers informed about the services you offer.
	</p>
	<p>
		Working on a team project remotely is a daunting task, but each of us finished the task we were
		given in a timely manner. We were also given option to be creative with doing ofur respective tasks.
	</p>
	<p>
		Overall it was a great a learning experience. We learned a lot about writing responsive CSS and semantic HTML markup.
		We are all very excited about the future of web design, and what it has to offer.
