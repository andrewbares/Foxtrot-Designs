		I had lots of fun designing this website. Even though we are a fictitious company, I have realized that having a website is very important for any business. If you own a business, it's important to maintain an online presence, and having a website for that business is a crucial step forward in keeping your potential customers informed about the services you offer.

		Working on a team project remotely is a daunting task, but each of us finished the task we were given in a timely manner. We were also given option to be creative with doing our respective tasks, so that was fun. I mainly wrote the desktop CSS for the home page and news page, and added small fixes to other places are appropriate.

		Overall it was a great a learning experience. We learned a lot about writing responsive CSS and semantic HTML markup. I am very excited about the future of web design, and what it has to offer.
