	<h2>Jeannie Leonard</h2>
	<p>When I first heard about the project during the class, I was really, really worried about it since 
	I am not exactly a 'web design' major and was barley doing the practice assignment week by week. But 
	when the team was put together, and started to email each other, led by Andrew, I felt very comfortable 
	with how we communicated with each other.
	</p>
	<p>I worked on making the logo of our company (team) for the website and CSS for mobile. Making the logo 
	took me a while with the idea, but was not hard task since I was used to the task. However CSS, I am not 
	familiar with it at all and struggled with it; and still struggling with it. I am still working on this now.
	</p>
	<p>To say few things about the team experience, first, I would say it was one of the most cooperative team that 
	I have worked with in my schooling. We each took parts and emailed everyday with the progress. I think we all 
	respected each other's opinion and worked together very well.
