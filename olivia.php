	<h2>Olivia Goldson</h2>
	<p>Overall this project was a helpful way for me to understand the basics about web coding. The Internet can hold and distribute information 
	in an instant this is why our world today can only survive having access to the Internet and in this project we were able to create a page 
	template for the Internet. Coding is a hard aspect to grasp because there are so many commands codes to compute but once you get the basics 
	and practice it becomes easier. In high school I was able to learn adobe creative suites package and was taught how to create a website not 
	using just code so class showed me the alternative way to create a webpage from scratch.</p>
	<p>In this group project, I created the home, pricing, and news HTML template. 
	My group allowed me to choose what I was best at so I knew that this was something I was capable of completing and I did. The process overall 
	was basic commands that was for the skeleton to our webpage. After I sent them to the rest of the group and they styled everything the way we 
	originally planned via email. My group was overall very helpful and we had great communication about our different parts to contribute to the 
	project.</p>
	<p>I think that this project was a great way to end the class by using everything we learned from the semester. This project gave me a better understanding 
	of the comprehensive planning that comes with creating a website or a company.</p>
