	<h2>Aaron Stewart</h2>
	<p>I had a great deal of fun and learned lots about web-design from working as a group with my classmates in designing this website.  Working together as a group creating Foxtrot Designs gave me a sense of what the real world would be like as a web-designer and I can safely say that it is something I can see myself pursuing.</p>
	<p>After fairly splitting up the assigned tasks, we immediately started designing and developing our fictitious web-design firm. Tasks were finished on time and it was 
	amazing to see Foxtrot Designs come alive. It felt like we were an actual web-design firm, something that I hope to be apart of one day.</p>
 	<p>In conclusion it was great learning experience for me, from working together as a group in achieving the desired finished product to seeing how other designers and developers think about completing the next task. We have learned a lot as a group and it is safe to say we are very excited about web-design and its future.</p>
